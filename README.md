# Online-Energy-Monitoring-System-With-Arduino
This code aims to gather energy datas such as current, voltage values as remote and it calculates the energy.
All of these datas are storing into SD card by means of datalogger shield.
All of the datas that gathered can seeing on the LCD panel as monitoring in real time.
Thanks to Wi-fi module, gathered datas can be transfered to desired website or applicationas online. In that case, thingspeak.com is used to send datas.
In that project, 1X Datalogger Shield, 1X I2C Led Shield, 1X Arduino Uno, 1X ESP8266 Wi-fi module, 1x ACS712 current sensor is used.
